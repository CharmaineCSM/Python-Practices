--Exercise--

What was the lowest annual mean unemployment rate among those born in Canada? 
Which year was it? Store your answers in variables named mean and year, respectively.

--Solution--

import pandas as pd 
df = pd.read_csv('canada.csv')
df1 = df[(df['birth']=='Canada')]
df1_by_year = df1.groupby('year').mean().sort_values('unemployment_rate (percentage)',ascending=True)

#run code to determine the lowest results for mean and year 

mean = 5.15
year = 2017
