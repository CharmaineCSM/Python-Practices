Here are my solutions to the Final Challenge questions for the Python course in Vertabelo. 

Understand that Vertabelo has good intentions of getting us to crack our head to find the answers to the quizzes. But it can be frustrating when one question is hindering you from completing the whole course (and the discussion board is of not much help either). 

There may be many other ways to find the answers, but here are my answers that got me through it. Hope this helps!
