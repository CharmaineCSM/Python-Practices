Question:
Implement RLE (run-length encoding): encode each character by the number of times it appears consecutively.

'aaaabbbcca' â‡’ [('a', 4), ('b', 3), ('c', 2), ('a', 1)]
(note that there are two groups of 'a')
'''

Solution:
s = "aaaabbbcca"

def rle(s):
    ans, cur, num = [], None, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i == 0:
            cur, num = s[i], 1
        elif cur != s[i]:
            ans.append((cur, num))
            cur, num = s[i], 1
        else:
            num += 1
        if i == len(s) - 1:
            ans.append((cur, num))
    return ans
            

print(rle(s))

Output --> [('a', 4), ('b', 3), ('c', 2), ('a', 1)]
