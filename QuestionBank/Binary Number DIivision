Question:

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. 
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence. Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:

binary_num = input("give me 4 numbers in binary format: ")
binary_num = binary_num.split(",")

# or using pythonic way
# binary_num = [x for x in input().split(",")]

print(binary_num)

result = []

for num in binary_num:
    nump = int(num, 2) #converting the numbers from binary system to integers and if the interger is divisible by 5, print the binary number
    if nump  % 5 == 0:
        result.append(num)

print(",".join(result))
